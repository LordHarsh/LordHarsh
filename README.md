## Currently working on
* A Neural style transfer project where artistic features and style of an image will be transfered to another image.

* A stone paper scissorsâœ‚- Here, you can play game with your computer by showing the symbol from your hand and computer will recognize it automatically using webcom. I will be using a custom machine learning model to do so. The image data I will collect will be from Kaggle, web scrapping and possibly a custom data too.
