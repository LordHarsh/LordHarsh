## Hi there, I am Harsh and you can call me....Harsh (he/him/his)ðŸ‘‹


## Currently working on
* A Neural style transfer project where artistic features and style of an image will be transfered to another image.

* A stone paper scissorsâœ‚- Here, you can play game with your computer by showing the symbol from your hand and computer will recognize it automatically using webcom. I will be using a custom machine learning model to do so. The image data I will collect will be from Kaggle, web scrapping and possibly a custom data too.



## Planning to do next...
* Improve the Face detection project by-
   * Adding a new better trained model (probably by using `VGGFace` data).
   * Adding support for live webcam.
   * Its gonna be fun...ðŸ¤©
* Create a ML algorithm to play chess.
  * Learn and understand `reinforcement learning`, then create an algorithm which can play chess with itself and create new stratigies from scratch.
  * Then make it play my school's chess club members.ðŸ˜‚
