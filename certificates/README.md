# These all all my Computer Related Certificates...

###### This is my favourite one. Here I got to make many-many projects including cat vs. dog recognition system, face recognition, art generation and more. There were also some case studies. Unluckily, I can't share the code due to the Coursera's honour policy.

    <td>Content: This course starts by telling you the basics of machine learning. Unlike manu other courses, here they tell "how" the algorithm accually works. Every week you get a kind of algotithm and learn its mathematics, progrogramming and use. They include- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Multiclass Classification, Neural Networks, SVMs and more.</td>
