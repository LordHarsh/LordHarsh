# Work in progress


##### These are the courses which are currently I am doing.


## Introduction to Quantum Computing with IBM Quantum
##### [The Coding School](https://www.codeconnects.org/)'s Qubit by Qubits's [Intrduction to Quantum Computing with IBM Quantum](https://www.qubitbyqubit.org/programs) is six months course which is divided into two semesters of three months each.
Students are selected for this course from all over the world through a statement of interest. Luckily, I was one of themðŸŽ‰. The first semester is about the basics requiered for Quantum Qumputing (including mathematics, physics and programming) and the second is about the actual Quantum Computing. You can register for it [here](https://www.qubitbyqubit.org/register).

Though I done a lot things related to data science but I am still lacking the core concepts and understanding of Data Science. So, I am taking this coursse by <b>John Hopkins University</b>. It's taught by <b>Jeff Leek</b> and will be taking about <b>2 months</b>.</td>

    <td  width="48%">This is a specialization on TensorFlow taught by <b>Laurence Moroney</b>. TensorFlow is a vast framework so I am taking it to increase by ability to do more with this platform. It's a <b>4 month</b> course from <b>Deeplearning.ai</b>.</td>
